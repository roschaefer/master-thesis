The first part of the framework considers (a) three levels of technology which have been designated DSS, (b) the developmental approach that is evolving for the creation of a DSS, and (c) the roles of several key types of people in the building and use of a DSS. The second part develops a descriptive model to assess the performance objectives and the capabilities of a DSS as viewed by three of the major participants in their continued development and use. The final section outlines several issues in the future growth and development of a DSS as a potentially valuable type of information system in organizations.},

  abstract="The decision-making process is marked by two kinds of elements: organizational and technical. The organizational elements are those related to companies' day-to-day functioning, where decisions must be made and aligned with the companies' strategy. The technical elements include the toolset used to aid the decision making process such as information systems, data repositories, formal modeling, and analysis of decisions. This work highlights a subset of the elements combined to define an integrated model of decision making using big data, business intelligence, decision support systems, and organizational learning all working together to provide the decision maker with a reliable visualization of the decision-related opportunities. The main objective of this work is to perform a theoretical analysis and discussion about these elements, thus providing an understanding of why and how they work together.",
