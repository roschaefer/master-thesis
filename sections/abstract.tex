Numerous visualization techniques exist for data-driven \dss{}.
Those systems primarily used to give guidance in geopolitical decisions often deal with hierarchical and geographical data.
There are well-researched data visualizations for both kinds individually.
For geographical there are choropleth maps, flow maps, bubble maps and for hierarchical data there are treemaps.
To this day however, no appropriate data visualization for hierarchical and geographical information in one view exists.
In this thesis, we evaluate \cmvs{} to combine the capabilities of both data visualizations.
We describe a framework to coordinate arbitrary data visualizations in theoretical terms and we give a reference implementation.
