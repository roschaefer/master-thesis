\begin{abstract}
Coordinated multiple views are a well known area of research and it has
been shown that they create better insights. However, coordinated
multiple views tend to become increasingly complex. In our use case we
introduce a version of coordinated multiple views that allows for
different levels of detail and therefore targets both experts and lay
people.

\section{Introduction}
In many cases, insights based on visualization techniques like
coordinated multiple views are used for strategic decision-making and
are made for experts. Thus, most data visualizations are made
exclusively for professionals. There is, however, a big popularity of
data visualizations in the media. E.g. data journalism is the fastest
growing segment in journalism. We believe that advanced data
visualization techniques like coordinated multiple views can be
successfully transferred in to a public environment.

brain: The eyes``.
