\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

As described in Chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}, the framework is lightweight, has good scalability and loose coupling.
With respect to the requirements of a framework of \cmvs{} it shows good serialization and data extensibility.
But the framework is responsible only to coordinate interactions, so the main effort of implementing interactions is still there.
