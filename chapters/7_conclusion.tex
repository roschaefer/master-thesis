\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

This thesis demonstrates how \cmvs{} can be used to improve comprehensibility and interactivity of \tmaps{}.
In particular, the approach was applied on multi-dimensional, geographical data with one additional, coordinated geographical visualization.
Apart from the specific use case, interactions in \cmvs{} were formally described and a conceptual framework was developed that can be used for arbitrary data visualizations.

Data analysts can use the new knowledge by applying \tmaps{} in the context of \dss{}.
This applies especially in application scenarios with a strong geographical context, e.g. local administration and urban planning.
It was shown that a coordinated geographical visualization can improve usability by providing orientation and a better recognition of regions and locations in \tmaps{}.
The enrichment of the original data set by adding geographical information, which is not present in the data set itself, turned out to be a great improvement.

The formalization of an interaction in \cmvs{} and the subsequent development of a conceptual framework is helpful for researchers and developers of visualization frameworks.
While \cmvs{} are a well researched topic, research was missing regarding a formalization of coordinated interactions.
Developers can built frameworks based on the conceptual framework specified in Chapter~\ref{cha:concept}.

As described in Chapter~\ref{sec:evaluation}, the framework is lightweight, has good scalability and loose coupling.
With respect to the requirements of a framework of \cmvs{} it shows good serialization and data extensibility.
But the framework is responsible only to coordinate interactions, so the main effort of implementing interactions is still there.
