\chapter{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

This chapter describes the actual implementation, starting with a list of implemented interactions.
After that, the components of the conceptual framework of Chapter~\ref{sec:concept} are translated into software components.
Finally, the resulting architecture is explained for every component and the integration into the existing \tmap{} implementation is shown.

\section{Implemented interactions}

Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:layout} shows a screenshot of the final \cmv{} application.
Different views are labeled and separated by red lines.
The \tmap{} is on the left, the \gv{} is on the right and some additional views to inspect and manually publish messages are below the \gv{}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/implementation/Layout}

    This Figure shows the layout of the \cmv{}, red lines separating different views.
    The currently visualized data set is called ``Wahlkreise'' and consists of German administrative districts.
    The layout of the \tmap{} is based on the unemployment rate, the colour is based on the percentage of high-school graduates.
  }\label{fig:implementation:layout}
\end{figure}

In the course of this thesis the following interactions have been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Select

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Highlighting an entity is possible by moving the mouse cursor on a geographic feature in the \gv{} or a block in the \tmap{}.
        The corresponding block or geographic feature will be highlighted respectively.
      \item
        A click on a block in the \tmap{} selects this entity in the \gv{} and vice versa.
        In Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:layout}, district ``Magdeburg'' is selected in the \gv{}.
        This district has an unusually high percentage of graduates compared to other districts with a similar unemployment rate.
      \item
        Holding the control key, multiple clicks on a block in the \tmap{} creates a group of selected entities.
        Corresponding geographic feature or blocks in the \tmap{} or \gv{} are selected as well.
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    Explore

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Selecting a block in the \tmap{} centers the viewpoint in the \gv{} on the corresponding geographic feature.
      \item Selecting a group of blocks in the \tmap{} centers the viewpoint in the \gv{} on the boundaries of all corresponding geographic features.
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    Reconfigure

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Choosing a different data set updates the geometries in the \gv{}.
      \item
        Selecting another shape for the \tmap{} (e.g. point instead of polygon geometries) changes the visual representation in the \gv{}.
    \end{itemize}

  % \item
  %   \emph{Filter}: The user double-clicks on a region in a geographical map and the \tmap{} will be based on data of only that region.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation of the Conceptual Framework}\label{sec:implementation:concept-translation}
This section is intended to show precisely, how the specification of Chapter~\ref{sec:concept} is implemented and translated to actual code.
As you recall, an interaction is defined as $I(T,(M(C,P,S),E))$, the message $M$ is the part that is communicated between views.
This message is published to a \attr{publish-subscribe} broker.
In Chapter~\ref{sec:concept} in Figure~\ref{fig:concept:component-diagram} this component is called \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} and conveniently, the class has the same name in the actual code base.
The coordinator has access to a database backend, just like in the component diagram, and the data will be fetched at runtime with an \gls{ajax} call.
The \attr{Input/Output} middleware in our case is the browser because a web based application is developed.
The browser provides an \gls{api} for the mouse, keyboard, microphone and even the webcam.

\subsection{PubSubJS as implementation for publish-subscribe}
In accordance to Chapter~\ref{sec:concept}, the implementation makes use of the \attr{publish-subscribe} pattern for coordination.
To achieve this, it uses the JavaScript library \attr{PubSubJS} which is an topic-based, asynchronous implementation of the pattern.
\attr{PubSubJS} allows nested topics, i.e.\ topics and sub-topics, and a subscriber will be notified if a topic or any of its sub-topics is published.
This means, a view can subscribe to a group of interactions.
E.g.\ the group \attr{mcv.select} includes both \attr{mcv.select.highlight} and \attr{mcv.select.focus}.

\subsection{Encoding of category and purpose as topic and sub-topic}\label{sec:implementationnceptual Framework}\label{sec:implementation:concept:translation:subject-purpose}
\attr{PubSubJS}'s nested topics can be used to encode categories and purposes.
This approach gives views more flexibility, because they can either subscribe to every interaction, all interactions of a category, or just a few specific interactions.
Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:encoding} gives an example of a select interaction with the purpose to focus on three entities.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/implementation/Encoding}
  \caption{%
    Example of the encoding of interaction category and purpose.
  }\label{fig:implementation:encoding}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Encoding of the subject as a JavaScript callback}
Not only basic data types like numbers and strings can be published, as seen in Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:subscribe}, but also functions.
In javascript, these functions are called ``callbacks''.
If an interaction of type \attr{filter} is published, the \attr{data} parameter of the subscription callback is itself a callback.
This callback would be a threshold function expecting an entity as parameter and returns whether or not the entity is filtered.

  label={lst:implementation:subscribe},
  caption={
    A simplified example how to subscribe to an interaction.
  }
]{listings/implementation/subscribe.js}

\subsection{Data Model implemented as GeoJSON}

\attr{GeoJSON} is used as implementation of the shared data model.
The format is used to encode a variety of geographic data structures~\parencite{GeoJSON2017}.
Based on JSON, it can represent simple geographic features like points, lines and areas and reserves a properties object for non-spatial attributes.

GeoJSON allows to encode an \attr{id} as a member in the feature object, which can be used to encode the \attr{id} of the entity.
Data attributes of entities are encoded as properties and hierarchic relationships are expressed via feature collections.

A GeoJSON example can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:geojson:example}, coordinates are ommited for brevity.
The GeoJSON property \attr{user\_count\_normalized} encodes a percentage of a user base per region.
This is one of the attributes that can be mapped to the colour of a \tmap{}.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:geojson:example},
  caption={
    A GeoJSON example of a user distribution across German federal states.
    Coordinates are omitted.
  }
]{listings/implementation/example.geojson}


\section{Architecture}
The architecture of the implementation is depicted in the class diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:architecture}.
For each of the views in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:layout} you can see a corresponding class in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:architecture}, i.e.\ \attr{Treemap}, \attr{MapComponent}, \attr{MessageLog} and \attr{DebugView}.

All views have a reference to \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} in order to subscribe to interactions.
The rendering \tmap{} is controlled by \attr{UAController}, thus it is connected to \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} through this class.
The \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} itself does not have a visual representation.

\subsection{UAController}
Written in plain TypeScript, the UAController handles mouse events and updates the 3D Canvas with \gls{webgl}.
The treemap is shown on the left side in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:layout}.
Click and mouse move events already highlight the respective item or show a detail view of the item.
It is part of the existing code base and so the only applied change to the UAController is the support of publications and subscriptions.
The \gv{} on the other hand needs to be implemented from scratch.

\subsection{Geographic Visualization with React Components}
The \gv{} is implemented with React components, Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:architecture} shows the superclass \attr{ReactComponent} of the classes \attr{MapComponent}, \attr{MessageView} and \attr{DebugView}.
Every React components have a \attr{render} method which is called for ever re-rendering of the component in the virtual \gls{dom}.
This re-rendering gets triggered if the properties of a component change.
Thus, if the properties of the parent component get passed to a child component, this child component will also re-render.

E.g. if the position of the view point of the \attr{MapComponent} changes, that will re-render the included \attr{Map} which depends on the position.
If the Geometries of the visualized data set are updated, that will change the \attr{GeoJSON} component but not the \attr{Map}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/implementation/Architecture.pdf}
  \caption{%
    Architecture of components.
    Every class with a \attr{render} method is a React component.
    \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} is used to coordinate \tmap{} and \gv{} as well as to load geometry data.
  }\label{fig:implementation:architecture}
\end{figure}

\section{Notifications}

The automatic update mechanism works only within the virtual \gls{dom} of React components.
Interactions among \cmvs{} need to be implemented manually.
For this purpose, the class \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} wraps the library \attr{PubSubJS} and works as a broker for interactions across \cmvs{}.

Let's take an example from a common usage scenario:
During initialization, all views subscribe to \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} in order to re-render after interactions.
Then the user chooses another data set and the geometries are updated.
After that, the user clicks with the mouse on a geographic feature and the corresponding item is focused.
You can see this scenario in the sequence diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:sequence-diagram}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/implementation/SequenceDiagram}
  \caption{%
    This sequence diagram shows the notification of different components during a common usage scenario:
    First a change of the data set followed by a click on a feature.
  }\label{fig:implementation:sequence-diagram}
\end{figure}


\section{Querying the GeoJSON endpoint}

Each view gets a reference to the \attr{MultiviewCoordinator}, e.g. during initialization, and can subscribe to interactions as seen in Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:subscribe}.
As a central part of the implementation, the \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} is also used for certain performance optimizations and data integrity considerations.
Therefore, it is responsible to query geometry data.

If the user selects a different data set, the \attr{url} of the GeoJSON endpoint changes and an update of the geometry data is required.
This behaviour is implemented by the \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} which observes all changes to the \attr{url} of the GeoJSON endpoint.
If the \attr{url} changes, the coordinator fetches geometry data, publishes a change of the geometries and all subscribed views can re-render.
This is also a performance optimization, as it reduces the number of requests to the \attr{GeoJSON} endpoint.

\section{Render views in the \gls{dom}}

Adding the \gv{} to the \gls{dom} is straightforward.
Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:dom} shows an example how to use React's low-level API to render components inside the \gls{dom}.
It uses a HTML id \attr{multiview-map-component} to reference a particular node in the HTML document.
The HTML document needs to import three JavaScript files, i.e.\ two imported libraries required by React and the compiled JavaScript application.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:implementation:dom},
  lastline=12,
  caption={
    Example application written in TypeScript.
    Views can be added to the \gls{dom} individually.
    The implementation exposes convenient TypeScript declarations, here \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} and \attr{MapComponent} are imported.
  }
]{listings/implementation/dom.tsx}

The implementation of the conceptual framework is written in \attr{TypeScript}.
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
It provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces and helps to reduce errors by raising type errors at compile time.
The implementation exports typescript declaration and you can see an import of the classes \attr{MapComponent} and \attr{MultiviewCoordinator} on lines 1 to 3 in Listing~\ref{lst:implementation:dom}.


\section{MapComponent}

The geographical visualization makes use of three components of the React Leaflet library:
\attr{Map}, \attr{TileLayer} and \attr{GeoJSON}.
Listing \ref{lst:implementation:render} shows the \attr{render} method of the component.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:implementation:render},
  firstline=162,
  lastline=183,
  caption={\attr{render} method of the Map component of the geographical visualization.}
]{listings/implementation/MapComponent.tsx}

The \attr{render} method is the only required method of a React component.
It will be invoked on the initial rendering of the component of the \gls{dom} and on every update of the component's properties.

React's templating language ``\attr{JSX}'' allows to nest other child components into the React parent component.
In this case the \attr{Map} component includes a \attr{TileLayer} \attr{GeoJSON} component from the \attr{react-leaflet} library.
This library conveniently provides ``React components for Leaflet maps.''~\parencite{ReactLeaflet2017}.

The subscriptions to the coordinator happen during the method \attr{didComponentMount}, a lifecycle callback method provided by React.
You can see the respective interaction handlers \attr{handleHighlight}, \attr{handleFocus} and \attr{handleGeometry} in the class diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:implementation:architecture}.


\subsection{GeoJSON Component}

The \attr{GeoJSON} component is provided by the \attr{Map} component with a couple of properties:
It gets a
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    geojsonURL as well as a
  \item
    geojson as data attribute. Furthermore a couple of callbacks is passed into the child component, including
  \item
    featureStyle,
  \item
    pointToLayer and
  \item
    onEachFeature.
\end{enumerate*}

This way, the parent \attr{Map} component controls the data flow and without a \attr{geojson} object, no polygons are placed on the map.
A changed \attr{geojsonURL} will always update the child component as it is used a \attr{key} on the \attr{GeoJSON} component.
The callbacks passed into the \attr{GeoJSON} component control the visual representation of each polygon and they add event handlers for a mouse click or a mouse move on each polygon.
Listing \ref{lst:implementation:onEachFeature} shows the event handlers added to the map.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:implementation:onEachFeature},
  caption={\attr{onEachFeature} callback, adding handlers for mouse events.}
]{listings/implementation/onEachFeature.tsx}

First all layers in the internal state of the \attr{Map} component are cached.
On each \attr{mouseover} event, the \attr{id} of the feature is published as \attr{mcv.select.highlight} interaction.
A \attr{click} event is distinguished if the control key is pressed or not.
In the latter case, the id of the feature is either added or removed from the list of focused ids and then the list of focused ids is published as \attr{mcv.select.focus} interaction.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:implementation:featureStyle},
  caption={\attr{featureStyle} callback, configuring the visual appearance depending on the currently highlighted or focused feature ids.}
]{listings/implementation/featureStyle.tsx}

The \attr{featureStyle} in Listing \ref{lst:implementation:featureStyle} method is very straightforward.
If the feature is currently focused, the \attr{fillColor} of the polygon is red, otherwise blue.
Likewise, if the feature is currently highlighted, the polygon has a white, solid stroke.

\lstinputlisting[
  label={lst:implementation:pointToLayer},
  caption={\attr{pointToLayer} callback, if a feature of \attr{GeoJSON} has a point geometry, it will be shown as a circle.}
]{listings/implementation/pointToLayer.tsx}

Finally, it is configured how to display point geometries in callback \attr{poinToLayer}.
Since normal markers do not have a configurable color and style, the \attr{GeoJSON} component is instructed to render a \attr{CircleMarker} for each point geometry instead.
This way, the same options of \attr{featureStyle} can be applied to both point and area geometries.
