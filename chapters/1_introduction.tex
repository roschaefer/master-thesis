\chapter{Introduction}
The human brain processes visual information better than it processes text.
As a result, data scientists often communicate their results with data visualizations.
These visualizations make the data accessible to readers and help them to spot anomalies.

Data visualizations on a computer allow the user to interact with the data and explore different levels of granularity.
Users can use an input device like a mouse or a keyboard to trigger an interaction and the visual representation of the data will change accordingly.
In many cases a great interactivity results in a great user experience, as the user can change the visual representation as desired.

There is a wide range of existing frameworks and implementations for data visualizations.
These frameworks often support interactions with additional controls and event handlers like mouse click events.

A few specific use cases extend these frameworks to show multiple views next to each other, with controls and event handlers to manipulate multiple views.
The user experience is even better compared with single data visualizations but the development effort for multiple views is high.
Currently, there is no dedicated or prevalent framework that helps to implement interactions in multiple visualizations of the same data.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:outline}
Many research papers in the field of \cmvs{} have focused more on visual representations than interaction aspects.
Even though interaction aspects give a great user experience and enable the user to find complex connections involving multiple views.
\textcite{Ho2013} assumes this may ``originate from the fact that the implementation of interaction techniques and interactive features normally takes much more time than the implementation of visual representations''.
Obviously, there is a lot of existing research in the area but a lack of research regarding interactions in particular.
This could also explain why hardly any general-purpose implementation exists to coordinate multiple views, that focuses on interactions.
It is for this reason that this thesis develops an interaction model for \cmvs{}, so future implementations can use this model as a specification.

Another motivation to do research in that particular area is a recent development in web application frameworks:
Many popular frameworks like Angular, Ember, React and Vue have developed mechanisms to update UI elements during user interactions.
These patterns and mechanisms have become so widespread and prevalent that they triggered even a web specification called ``web components''.
Obviously, these update mechanisms are a promising choice for \cmvs{}.
They have not gained research interest yet, probably because of the very recent development.

\section{Problem Statement}
%
A \tmap{} of geographic data may loose the geographic context if the tiling algorithm is based on non-geographic attributes.
An administrative district that is located in the east of a second district may be placed in the \tmap{} left of it instead of being placed on the right side.
If the tiling algorithm uses a non-geographic hierarchy, the geographic context will be lost entirely.
Items that should belong together according to their geographic circumstances may be scattered across the \tmap{}.
Users have a hard time to recognize geographic areas and locations which deteriorates the comprehensibility of the \tmap{}.
Selecting and grouping items based on their geographic proximity becomes increasingly difficult if the items are scattered across the \tmap{}.


\section{Hypothesis}

A second, \gv{} next to the \tmap{} can preserve the geographic context if these two views are combined in a \cmv{}.
The user can relate an item in the \tmap{} if the item is linked with the corresponding item in the \gv{} and vice versa.
Many items can be selected in the geographic map based on their proximity by dragging a bounding box around them.
In the \tmap{} the user can select many items based on their proximity in a non-geographic dimension and see the selection in the \gv{}.
Essentially,  the limitations of a single \tmap{} or a single \gv{} can be overcome by splitting up the interaction:
The user can trigger the interaction in one view and see the effect, i.e.\ the change of visual representation, in another view.


%Hypothese ist, dass durchs Visualisierungs-, Navigations- und Interaktionstechniken eine Kopplung von georäumlichen 2D-Kartendarstellungen und thematisch-orientierten 3D-Treemaps ermöglicht wird und dadurch die Exploration und Analyse von multidimensionalen georäumlichen Daten unterstützt werden kann.

\section{Contributions}

In order to validate the conceptual framework for \cmvs{}, we develop a reference implementation to investigate its feasibility.
The development of the reference implementation is subdivided into the following packages:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Concept

    Based on a number of examples, a basic, conceptual framework is designed.
    This includes a common data structure, a formalization of an interaction in general and the communication protocol for multiple views.

  \item
    Implementation

    We develop a geographical representation of the data.
    Items in the map can be focused, highlighted, selected with multiple clicks or with a bounding box.
    This creates a powerful selection mechanism, which can be used to select data in map-based representations and highlight the data in the \tmap{}.

  \item
    Integration of \tmap{} and \map{}

    We develop linking and interaction mechanisms between \maps{} (for map-based representation) and \tmaps{} (for abstract information representation).

  \item
    Demonstration and evaluation

    \cmv{} layouts and suitable views are implemented and tested for the selected test data.
    Based on the test data sets, the \cmv{} implementation is examined and evaluated for design criteria~\cite{Baldonado2000}, general usability aspects~\cite{Roberts2007} and usage for typical visual analytics tasks.
\end{enumerate}

% \section{Methodological Approach}
%
% A literature research is used to gather knowledge about the current state of the art with respect to \cmvs{}.
% Existing concepts and implementations available on the internet are examined and reused if possible.
% Interviews of people from the target group are conducted and the define the requirements for the application.
% A minimal viable product is developed to further validate the user requirements.
% Also, common user behaviour is observed during user tests.
% The prototype is continuously developed to allow for further experimentation.
%
% \paragraph{Scenarios}
% While implementing more features, we have two scenarios with different kind of data and different user requirements:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     In our work on the project \rufu{} we design and prototype visualizations for media researchers.
%     We fully control the database and the database schema as well as on the user facing application on top of it.
%     User requirements are tied to journalists, media researchers, broadcasting corporations.
%     The data has geographical, hierarchical, temporal and correlated characteristics.
%   \item
%     The \visan{} for administrative data is used as a more general purpose application.
%     There is no single database schema but combatibility with many sources or services.
%     User requirements are potentially unknown and part of the resarch.
%     The usage focuses especially on geographical and hierarchical data.
% \end{itemize}
%
% For the scope of this master thesis we therefore compare implemented visualization and views.
% How do both approaches differ in development speed, value for the customer?
% What considerations need to be done regarding the database schema?

\section{Structure of the Work}

In Section~\ref{sec:related-work} we introduce basic terminology of \cmvs{} and the theoretical background in this area of research.
This Section also covers the state of the art and research on multiple views and coordinated interactions.
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis} we analyze a set of data visualizations and their interactions by example.
The gained knowledge from that section is used in the following Section~\ref{sec:concept} for a formalization of the \cmv{} framework.
In Section~\ref{sec:implementation} we describe the reference implementation.
Then in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we take the requirements from Section~\ref{sec:analysis} to evaluate the conceptual framework and its implementation.
Finally sum up the main contributions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} and outline the future work.
